# Expectation and Integration

Expectation = Lebesgue integral.

## 1. Discrete
```
E[X] = Σ x_i P(X=x_i)
```

## 2. Continuous
```
E[X] = ∫ x f(x) dx
```

## 3. General (Lebesgue)
```
E[X] = ∫Ω X dP
```

## Properties
- Linearity  
- Monotonicity  
- Jensen’s inequality  

## Variance and moments
Variance = E[(X−EX)^2].  
MGF, characteristic function define moments.
