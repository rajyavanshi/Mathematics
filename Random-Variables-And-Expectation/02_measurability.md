# Measurability

A function X is a random variable if:
```
{ω : X(ω) ≤ x} ∈ 𝔽
```
for all real x.

## Why important?
Ensures events involving X have well-defined probabilities.

## σ(X)
The σ-algebra generated by X:
```
σ(X) = {X⁻¹(A) : A ∈ ℬ(ℝ)}
```

## Applications in finance
Defines information sets → filtrations → martingales → stochastic calculus.
