# Banach–Tarski Paradox

![Banach–Tarski Illustration](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Banach-Tarski-Paradox.svg/512px-Banach-Tarski-Paradox.svg.png)

The Banach–Tarski paradox states that:

> A solid 3D ball can be cut into finitely many pieces and reassembled into **two identical copies** of the original ball using only rotations and translations.

## Why It Happens
- The pieces are **non-measurable sets**.  
- They have **no well-defined volume**.  
- The group of rotations in 3D contains a **free group**, enabling paradoxical decompositions.

## Why It Doesn't Happen in Reality
- Matter is not infinitely divisible.  
- Physics does not allow AC-style selections.  
- Real objects are not sets of real numbers.

## Why It Motivates Measure Theory
Banach–Tarski shows that if you try to measure *all* subsets, contradictions appear.  
Measure theory restricts us to measurable sets, saving consistency of:
- volume  
- probability  
- integration  

## Relevance to Quant & ML
Advanced probability relies on measurable sets for:
- stochastic calculus  
- Brownian motion  
- expectations  
- risk-neutral measures  

Without these restrictions, probability theory becomes inconsistent — just like volume becomes inconsistent in Banach–Tarski.
