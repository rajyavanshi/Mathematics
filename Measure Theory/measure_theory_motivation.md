Measure theory is the foundation behind modern probability, quantitative finance, machine learning, information theory, and stochastic processes. At first, it may feel abstract — σ-algebras, measurable sets, non-measurable sets, and Lebesgue measure — but these concepts exist because classical intuition breaks for complicated sets.

## 1. Why Classical Measures Fail
Not every subset of ℝ, ℝ², or ℝ³ can have a consistent length, area, or volume. Some sets are too irregular; assigning them a measure leads to contradictions.

Measure theory solves this by restricting attention to **measurable sets**, guaranteeing consistency.

## 2. Measure Theory Builds the Safe Universe
It ensures:
- well-defined probabilities  
- integrals that always work  
- convergence theorems  
- solid foundations for stochastic calculus and SDEs

## 3. Importance in Quant & ML
Measure theory is crucial for:
- defining continuous random variables  
- expectations as Lebesgue integrals  
- martingales and filtrations  
- stochastic processes and pricing models  

## 4. Key Insight
Measure theory prevents logical disasters (like Banach–Tarski). Without it, probability and volume theory would collapse.
